For personal reasons, I will no longer continue to develop this script, I also ended up playing The West a few months ago. Well you don't have to worry, the development of the script will continue, but no longer with me as its lead developer. The development of the script will be completely taken over by my good friend Taura, who has worked on it before. Taura knows that I had some ideas that I didn't have time to finish, so I hope she will take a look at them at some point. Well, it's up to you and especially the feedback on this script that she will receive in the future.

I loved this game, I spent hundreds of hours developing TWIR and I also liked you and the feedback you gave us, which I hope will continue after I leave. Please don't ask me why I'm leaving. I will not answer.
Thank you for your support during these years and I wish you all the best.
